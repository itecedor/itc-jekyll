<img src="/images/photographysite.png" class="post-thumb alignleft">For this project, the client, **Seth of Seth Wernow Photography**, showed me exactly how he wanted his site to look. He sent me a link to another site, one done in Flash (gag, cough, gag some more), and I told him what I could do for him without using Flash. The result is a minimalist photography site where the photos shine through above everything else.

To ensure a quick turnaround and a solid site with fast load times and excellent SEO capabilities, I again used [Thesis](http://ivetetecedor.com/links/thesis) for this project.

If you click through to the Thesis site with the above link, you’ll see that the default look of Thesis literally looks nothing like the finished product. That shows the flexibility of a theme framework like Thesis and helps explain why I’ve used it on so many client sites over the last few years!
