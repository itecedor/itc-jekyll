<img src="/images/fiversucks.jpg" class="post-thumb alignleft">So on Saturday, I was reading [Niche Pursuits](http://www.nichepursuits.com/) and getting ideas for how to build up a niche URL I own, when I decided to look into the possibility of having content written for me. One of the sites I found for this was fiverr.com, which I signed up for immediately after browsing around for a bit.

I liked the concept of the site and decided to test it out by listing a gig of my own before actually hiring anyone. I wrote a gig offering my services in setting up my favorite WordPress shopping cart plugin, the WordPress eStore Plugin.

This morning I received two automated emails from Fiverr:

And a few minutes later:

I certainly had NOT “provided or offered a direct payment to another user” or “posted your PayPal email address,” so I was pretty confused. Since both of these emails came from noreply@, I knew that responding to them would get me nowhere, so I clicked through to their site to try to get more information.

I found their Customers Support link at the bottom of the page and sent them the following message:

“Hi, I just received a warning regarding “provided or offered a direct payment to another use” but I have no idea what you are talking about. Can you please tell me what exactly I did that caused this warning?”

And here’s how the customer service ticket played out:

First CS response email:

So basically I asked “what does XYZ mean” and the response was “it means XYZ”. Ugh.

Since he didn’t help at all, I decided to try to figure it out myself. Because the only interaction I’d had with the site was the one gig I listed, I figured something I wrote in the gig must have been the problem. So I log into the site and find my gig and click it, only to get this:

Nice. Total user experience fail.

So since I could get nowhere on my own, I replied back to the CS guy:

Then the second useless reply came back from CS:

Frustrated, I (idiotically) tried again:

For some reason I was still surprised that the next CS email was completely useless too:

![8](/images/fiver8.png)

Not only did he completely ignore my question, he told me to submit a new gig without being able to see what was wrong with my original gig. That’s real helpful. It’ll be real easy to submit a new gig without making the same mistake again now.

At this point I was so annoyed that I sent back this bitchy reply:

![9](/images/fiver9.png)

I then started typing out this post, and went back to the site to try to cancel my account.

**Guess what?** There’s no way to cancel an account on Fiverr! Just adds insult to injury.

I settled for changing my account email address to cancelled@cancelled.com.

When I returned to my email a bit later, I was surprised to see another reply from the CS agent:
