<img src="/images/resume-site.png" class="post-thumb alignleft">For Flavie Bagnol‘s site, the client, Flavie, wanted to convey a playful, feminine vibe without veering into the girly or cheesy. She showed me images of 50’s pinup girls and asked me to take colors from a specific image she loved, and I went from there.

The main design elements on this project were the colors and fonts. In the end I created a simple “about me” type website for her that conveys all the information in one single page. When she’s ready to add more sections to the site, it will be super-easy since it’s built on WordPress (of course!). For now, the single-page site works perfectly for her purpose, which is to have an online presence to make it easy for people to find and contact her.

I again used the [Thesis](http://diythemes.com/) theme for this project and am very proud of the way it came out! This is one of my favorite projects for sure.
