[<img src="/images/bumblebeansbasics-300x256.png" class="post-thumb alignleft">](http://bumblebeansbasics.com/)My client (and friend) [Victoria Findlay Wolfe](http://www.bumblebeansinc.com/) is a well-known quilter and one of the leaders of the Modern Quilt movement. One of the many, many projects she works on is a charity that collects and distrubtes handmade quilts for various organizations/disasters. The charity is called [Bumble Beans BASICS](http://bumblebeansbasics.com/) and it’s helped with lots of projects already, including recently sending thousands of quilts to those displaced by Sandy.

Can you tell I really like this project’s mission yet? Well I do. And I quite like the website we ended up with too!

This is custom WordPress build that involves two different [custom post types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types) for managing content on the back end. I built it as a child theme of the [WooThemes Mystile Theme](http://www.woothemes.com/products/mystile/), which has become my new go-to base theme to build on top of, whether or not the site uses WooCommerce.

As is my preference, I did all the customization and custom features in the child theme, not by using plugins. In fact the only two plugins the site uses are:

* Woo’s excellent [WooSlider](http://www.woothemes.com/products/wooslider/) for image carousels (which I loathe building from scratch)
* The most thorough forms plugin ever, [Gravity Forms](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=166890), for handling a complicated quilt submission form for internal reporting purposes.

I’m very pleased with how much “extra” this site does with only those two plugins to deal with!
