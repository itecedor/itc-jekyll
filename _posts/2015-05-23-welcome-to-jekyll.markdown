If you, like me, use a podcast app other than iTunes or Stitcher, it’s really annoying trying to find the RSS feed url to subscribe to a new podcast that doesn’t explicitly tell you what the url is. Lately I’ve seen a lot of podcasts just listed in someone’s blog like this:

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
