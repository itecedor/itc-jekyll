<img src="/images/problogger-ebooks.jpg" class="post-thumb alignleft">When ProBlogger came out with the first version of his [31 Days to Build a Better Blog eBook](http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/), I snapped it right up . . . and then promptly stopped reading it after a few pages, because my insane job at a startup allowed me almost no time for personal projects.

Now that I’m freelancing full time (need a WordPress expert for a project? Contact me!), I’ve set myself the goal of working through the 31DBBB book from start to finish. But to kick it up a notch, I’m working through it for **four digital properties at the same time**.

Want to watch my progress? Subscribe to the RSS feed for each site, and feel free to yell at me in the comments if you see me slacking off!

###The sites are:

My knitting patterns business, [Chiagu.com](http://chiagu.com)
My cooking blog, [A Chef’s Daughter](http://achefsdaughter.com)
My brand-new (less than a week old!) WordPress blog, WordPress Hound
My site about working at a NYC startup, Inside The Alley

And some exercises I might even do on a few of my other properties, too . . .

I’ll be documenting my progress on this blog. My plan is not only to tell you what I’m working on, but to also show you any tangible results I’m able to track from the work I’m doing.

I’m confident that if I work through this book that all my properties will increase in value, traffic, and revenue. But I don’t have a great track record of setting goals for myself and then working through them to completion. So can I do this? Only time will tell!
