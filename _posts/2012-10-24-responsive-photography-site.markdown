[<img src="/images/poff.png" class="post-thumb alignleft">](http://thepoffertjesman.com/)My clients, the owners of [The Poffertjesman](http://thepoffertjesman.com/), needed to upgrade from an extremely outdated site to something new and modern that would more closely convey their brand. Their only requirement was the use of the Depot font, as that’s the font they’d done all their print work in. They also provided me with many stunning photos of their adorable mini pancakes and their booth.

Inspired by the photography, I immediately knew that I wanted to create a minimal site where the photography was the star. I built on top of the [Reverie](http://themefortress.com/reverie/) framework to make the site responsive (an absolute must for a client like this, whose visitors are likely to be on mobile devices while searching them out), and used the robust [EasyRotator](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easyrotator-for-wordpress/) plugin to ensure the clients would be able to work with the home page slider easily.
