I just heard about [Superfly](https://www.superfly.com/) through TechCrunch and it looks like a great site. Signed up for a beta slot but wanted to also give them props for a beautiful signup page!

I love the color palette, the background graphic, the layout, the logo . . . well, everything I guess. If you sign up you’ll also get to see the nice animation that happens after signup, which is subtle yet noticeable. Great job to whoever’s behind it!
